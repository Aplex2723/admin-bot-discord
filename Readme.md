### Updating to new version

Download [latest build](https://github.com/Sparker-99/Admin-bot/releases) and Extract into old version directory.
+ Existing `config.json` and `database` folder will be not overwritten by the update.
  + NOTE: any update of the `config_default.json` need to be merged manually by the user to the `config.json`.
+ Any edit done on default `commands` files will be lost. Consider backup or rename the file before update.
+ Admin bot v3.0.5 or higher uses `Node 16` which kills any application with critical exceptions. So its recommended to use any program that restarts the bot.

### FAQ

* #### Does Admin bot stores my ID and Password for Webfront ?

  + **No**, Admin bot retrieves **cookies** üç™ from webfront which is saved and used for executing commands from Discord. Cookies are valid for 30 days or until host machine restart. You can successfully delete id and password in dm after login success message.

* #### Why does the connect in serverinfo command not working ?

  + Not all clients support **direct connect**. Even it supports I dont know its launch url. If you know the launch url for **direct connect** for any client contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tGkbpCD)

* #### Why not use a proper Sqlite database instead of Json database ?

  + Sqlite Requires [Node-Gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) which is a hassle for most windows users. So for Advanced Users [Admin bot with Sqlite](https://github.com/Sparker-99/Admin-bot/tree/sqlite3) is available. There is no need for this tool in case of linux.
